Description:    This module is focused in reading the Comprehensive Global Administrative Zones (CGAZ) dataset
                provided by GeoBoundaries.org, filter the respective polygons and simplify their geometries for 
                their use in the ROLI Map Generator App. The CGAZ dataset can be found here: 
                https://www.geoboundaries.org/downloadCGAZ.html
